    <h2>THE KNEE</h2>
    The knee can also cause problems when it's too loose, too stiff, or when the cartilage is damaged or worn out. Here are the most common knee problems seen in our patients:

  <h4>KNEE INSTABILITY</h4>
  Instability of the knee. The knee can become unstable or loose following an injury. Often the knee will swell within a few hours and over the next few days. It may feel like it will "give out". We recommend that if you have an injury where the knee gives out and becomes swollen, you should be evaluated by a physician before returning to activities. Examples of ligament injuries in the knee include:<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h5>(ACL) Anterior Cruciate Ligament</h5>
  We read about these injuries in the Sports section all the time.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>(PCL) Posterior Cruciate Ligament</h5>
  These are much less common.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>(MCL) Medial Collateral Ligament</h5>
  These are very common as well, but usually heal on their own when they occur as an isolated injury.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Patellar (Knee Cap) Instability</h5>
  There can be either subluxation (partial dislocation) or full dislocation. This often is the result of a torn MPFL (Medial Patello Femoral Ligament).<br>

  <h4>CARTILAGE</h4>
  There are two types of "cartilage" in the knee. The surface cartilage (also called articular cartilage) lines the surfaces of the joint. When we are eating chicken and breaking open the chicken bone, for example, we see that smooth glistening surface. That is the articular cartilage. The meniscus is the second type of cartilage in the knee and is a bushing between the smooth articular cartilage surfaces.<br>

  <h5>MENISCUS TEAR</h5>
  These can be sudden (acute) or chronic. They are usually the result of injury in people younger than 40, but often occur in patients over 40 without any trauma at all. We have a medial (inner) and a lateral (outer) meniscus. Each can suffer injury.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>ARTICULAR CARTILAGE INJURY</h5>
  Some of that glistening cartilage inside the knee can be damaged by injury or sometimes by developmental or genetic conditions. This can be very challenging problems, particularly in younger patients. The areas most commonly involved include the end of the femur as well as the under-surface of the patella (knee cap).<br>
  <br>

  <h5>MALALIGMENT</h5>
  When a joint such as the knee is malaligned or crooked, the surfaces can wear out more quickly or simply cause pain. This can be seen with bowed legs or knock knees (the opposite of bowed legs). Bowed legs tend to have problems with the inner side of the knee whereas "knock knees" tend to have more problems with the outer or lateral compartment. When damage occurs to those compartments, sometimes we need to straighten out the knee in order to get proper healing of the damaged area. This also occurs when the patella (kneecap) is not aligned properly. This can cause early wear on the cartilage as well as pain and sometimes a tendency for the kneecap to be unstable.<br>

  <h4>ARTHRITIS</h4>
  The articular cartilage of the knee has no nerve endings. In fact, if I took a needle and poked the cartilage on the end of the femur, it wouldn't cause pain. However, the bone beneath that smooth glistening cartilage has lots of nerve endings. That's why "bone on bone" arthritis can be so painful. We have 3 compartments in the knee that can be affected by arthritis. If only one compartment is affected, there are more options for treatment than when the arthritis is more generalized.
