    <h2>THE SHOULDER</h2>
    Shoulder problems? As you can see, the shoulder can cause problems when it's too loose, too stiff, or when the tendons or cartilage wears out. Here are the five most common shoulder problems seen in our patients:

  <h4>ROTATOR CUFF</h4>
  The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons that give strength to the shoulder and assist in raising the arm up and rotation of the shoulder. The following conditions involve the rotator cuff and often cause pain in addition to weakness.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h5>Impingement and Rotator Cuff Tendonitis</h5>
  These are often synonymous. It can be an early precursor to a rotator cuff tear. The term "impingement" often refers to a bone spur rubbing on the surface of the rotator cuff causing pain.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Rotator Cuff Tears</h5>
  These can be partial, full-thickness, small, medium, or even massive. They can be due to sudden injury (acute tears) or due to long-standing overuse (chronic tears).<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Calcific Tendonitis</h5>
  This condition occurs when a calcium deposit forms within the rotator cuff tendon. The cause of this is unknown, but it can present itself as relatively sudden onset of severe pain, usually with no history of injury.<br>

  <h4>SHOULDER INSTABILITY</h4>
  Shoulder instability could be the result of a number of activites, although the most common shoulder injuries include Shoulder Subluxation, Shoulder Dislocation, or Shoulder Separation.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>SHOULDER SUBLUXATION</h5>
  This occurs when the shoulder doesn't fully come out of the socket, but slides part way out and then back in on its own. This is frequently seen in active, younger patients that are "double-jointed" with loose ligaments.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>SHOULDER DISLOCATION</h5>
  This is usually due to sudden trauma and often needs to be "reduced", or put back into place in an Emergency room. It can also happen after a seizure.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>SHOULDER SEPARATION</h5>
  A separation of the shoulder is very different from a dislocation since it involves the small joint at the end of the collar bone called the acromioclavicular joint or the "AC joint". Since we are the team physicians for the Milwaukee Admirals, we see lots of this injury since it's so common in professional hockey. It can also happen with other sports or activities that involve a fall onto the shoulder.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>SLAP TEARS</h5>
  The lining of the socket of the shoulder has a cartilage structure surrounding it called the labrum. The labrum can tear following a traumatic dislocation, but since the labrum goes 360 degrees around the shoulder, it can tear in any location. It usually tears in the direction of the dislocation. A "SLAP" tear simply describes where the labrum is torn. When the Superior (top part) Labrum tears from Anterior (front) to Posterior (back), we call it a SLAP tear. This is a category of its own because it can be seen without a dislocation or subluxation.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>FROZEN SHOULDER/ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS</h5>
  Sometimes the shoulder tightens up and loses motion resulting in a frozen shoulder. It can be due to trauma, but can also occur without any injury. The hallmarks of this condition include pain and stiffness (loss of motion). This is more common in diabetic patients and can be more difficult to treat in diabetics, but is seen in non-diabetics as well. Note that if you have this and you are not diabetic, it doesn't mean that you are more likely to get diabetes.<br>

  <h4>ARTHRITIS</h4>
  Unfortunately, arthritis can involve any joint in our bodies. It is less common in non weight-bearing joints like the shoulder or elbow than in knees or hips, but the rate of arthritis of the shoulder is on the incline. We really don't know the causes behind the increased incidence. It involves loss of the smooth glistening surface of the joint. Sometimes a small area can lose its cartilage and other times, larger areas lose all the cartilage and the shoulder becomes "bone on bone". If a young athlete has an injury to the shoulder and loses a section of cartilage it is treated very differently than an older person where there is truly bone on bone arthritis.<br>
  <br>

  These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. One of the most difficult problems to treat is when a person has arthritis along with a torn rotator cuff. Fortunately, there have been new developments in this area offering patients far more choices in treatment.
