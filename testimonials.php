  "I would like to thank you for the amazing job you did in the surgery repairing my right rotator cup. It certainly was a long road to recovery, but it now feels free of pain and has near 100% range of motion. I cannot describe the blessing this has been, my work is what not only provides me with an income of making a living but is also my dignity that gives me self worth and allows me to continue my trade that I enjoy doing."

  "Dr. Mark Wichman performed knee surgery on me this winter. He is an honest and confident surgeon. He was patient when answering all my questions. He changed my life. He gave me back a part of myself I haven't had in four years. He gave me the ability to function while performing daily normal activities, and high stress activities without pain.I couldn't be more pleased with my experience with him and his work. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Talented man! He exceeded my expectations!"

  "Dr. Matthew Wichman was fantastic. He seemed extremely committed to getting me back to all of the activities I enjoy such as running, basketball and downhill skiing. He was patient and answered my questions. He even took time to review my MRI with me. We talked about many treatment options and he help me choose the option that worked best for me and my family."

  "Dr. Mark Wichman has been my orthopedic doctor for 18 years. I started with a torn cartilage in my left knee that happened to me while camping/hiking in 1998. I had arthroscopic surgery on that knee. A couple of years later I tore the cartilage in my other knee and needed arthroscopic surgery on that knee. In 2005 I had a partial knee replacement on my left knee. In 2008 I had knee replacement on both knees&mdash;one in Aug; the other in Nov. I had many visits with Dr Wichman over the years."

  I was referred to Dr. Wichman by my primary care doctor. I really liked him and the way he spends his time and explain things to me. I never feel rushed out and if I have questions or concerns, he answers them for me. After I decided to have the surgery I was afraid but somehow I had great faith in Dr. Wichman that I wasn't so afraid anymore and just believed in him. He did an excellent work on my knee and I am very fortunate that my primary care sent me to him. He is an awesome doctor and I have heard many good things about him and now I see why. My knee turned out good and now its healing well and I'm up and about. His NP Theresa and his nurse Samantha were awesome throughout my visit with him. They helped me with my forms for short term disability and were always concern about the well being of my knee. His whole staff has been great with me and I appreciate everything they have done for me. I am very blessed to have met him and his staff.
