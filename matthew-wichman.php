  <div class="team-right">
    I earned my medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. My orthopaedic surgery residency was completed at McGaw Medical Center at Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill. I then completed advanced training in sports medicine through my fellowship at Santa Monica Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Foundation in California.<br>
    <br>

    In addition to general orthopaedics, I have special interest and training in sports medicine, adolescent sports medicine, and hip, knee and shoulder arthroscopy. I am also able to communicate in Spanish with my patients.<br>
    <br>

    In my free-time, I enjoy photography, guitar, skiing, exercising and playing a variety of sports. I am originally from the Milwaukee area and currently reside in Mequon with my wife, Aree, and our children.<br>
