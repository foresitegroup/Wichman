  <h4 id="fai">FEMEROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT (FAI)</h4>
  Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition where the bones of the hip are abnormally shaped.  There is a mismatch between the ball (femoral head) and the socket (acetabulum) Because they do not fit together perfectly, the hip bones rub against each other and cause damage to the joint.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip1.jpg" alt="" class="right">

  <h5>Anatomy</h5>
  The hip is a ball-and-socket joint. The socket is formed by the acetabulum, which is part of the large pelvis bone. The ball is the femoral head, which is the upper end of the femur (thighbone).<br>
  <br>

  A slippery tissue called articular cartilage covers the surface of the ball and the socket. It creates a smooth, low friction surface that helps the bones glide easily across each other.<br>
  <br>

  The acetabulum is ringed by strong fibrocartilage called the labrum. The labrum forms a gasket around the socket, creating a tight seal and helping to provide stability to the joint.<br>
  <br>

  In a healthy hip, the femoral head fits perfectly into the acetabulum.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Description</h5>
  In FAI, extra bone develops around the femoral head and/or along the acetabulum. The bone overgrowth causes the hip bones to rub against each other, rather than to move smoothly. Over time, this can result in the tearing of the labrum and breakdown of articular cartilage (osteoarthritis).<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <hr>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h4>TYPES OF FAI</h4>
  There are three types of FAI: pincer, cam, and combined impingement.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Pincer:</strong> This type of impingement occurs because extra bone extends out over the normal rim of the acetabulum. The labrum can be crushed under the prominent rim of the acetabulum.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Cam:</strong> In cam impingement the femoral head is not round and cannot rotate smoothly inside the acetabulum. A bump forms on the edge of the femoral head that grinds the cartilage inside the acetabulum.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Combined/Mixed:</strong> Combined impingement just means that both the pincer and cam types are present.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip13.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  <h5>How FAI Progresses</h5>
  It is not known how many people may have FAI. Some people may live long, active lives with FAI and never have problems. When symptoms develop, however, it usually indicates that there is damage to the cartilage or labrum and the disease is likely to progress. Symptoms may include pain, stiffness, and limping.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Cause</h5>
  FAI occurs because the hip bones do not form normally during the childhood growing years. It is the deformity of a cam bone spur, pincer bone spur, or both, that leads to joint damage and pain. When the hip bones are shaped abnormally, there is little that can be done to prevent FAI.<br>
  <br>

  Because athletically active people may work the hip joint more vigorously, they may begin to experience pain earlier than those who are less active. However, exercise does not cause FAI.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Symptoms</h5>
  People with FAI usually have pain in the groin area, although the pain sometimes may be more toward the outside of the hip. Sharp stabbing pain may occur with turning, twisting, and squatting, but sometimes, it is just a dull ache.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Home Remedies</h5>
  When symptoms first occur, it is helpful to try and identify an activity or something you may have done that could have caused the pain. Sometimes, you can just back off on your activities, let your hip rest, and see if the pain will settle down. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (ibuprofen, naproxen) may help.<br>
  <br>

  If your symptoms persist, you will need to see a doctor to determine the exact cause of your pain and provide treatment options. The longer painful symptoms go untreated, the more damage FAI can cause in the hip.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Doctor Examination</h5>
  During your first appointment, Dr. Wichman will discuss your general health and your hip symptoms. He or she will also examine your hip.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Impingement Test</h5>
  As part of the physical examination, Dr. Wichman will likely conduct the impingement test. For this test, Dr. Wichman will bring your knee up towards your chest and then rotate it inward towards your opposite shoulder. If this recreates your hip pain, the test result is positive for impingement.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Imaging Tests</h5>
  Dr. Wichman may order imaging tests to help determine whether you have FAI.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>X-rays:</strong> These provide good images of bone, and will show whether your hip has abnormally shaped bones of FAI. X-rays can also show signs of arthritis.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans:</strong> These studies can create better images of soft tissue. They will help Dr. Wichman find damage to the labrum and articular cartilage. Injecting dye into the joint during the MRI may make the damage show up more clearly. Dr. Wichman may also inject a numbing medicine into the joint as a diagnostic test. If the numbing medicine provides temporary pain relief, it confirms that FAI is the problem.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Computed tomography (CT) scans:</strong> More detailed than a plain x-ray, CT scans help Dr. Wichman see the exact abnormal shape of your hip.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <hr>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h4>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h4>
  <h5>Nonsurgical Treatment</h5>
  <strong>Activity changes:</strong> Dr. Wichman may first recommend simply changing your daily routine and avoiding activities that cause symptoms.<br>

  <strong>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications:</strong> Drugs like ibuprofen can be provided in a prescription-strength form to help reduce pain and inflammation.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Specific exercises can improve the range of motion in your hip and strengthen the muscles that support the joint. This can relieve some stress on the injured labrum or cartilage.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Surgical Treatment</h5>
  If tests show joint damage caused by FAI and your pain is not relieved by nonsurgical treatment, Dr. Wichman may recommend surgery.<br>
  <br>

  Many FAI problems can be treated with arthroscopic surgery. Arthroscopic procedures are done with small incisions and thin instruments. The surgeon uses a small camera, called an arthroscope, to view inside the hip.<br>
  <br>

  During arthroscopy, Dr. Wichman can repair or clean out any damage to the labrum and articular cartilage. He can correct the FAI by trimming the bony rim of the acetabulum and also shaving down the bump on the femoral head. Some severe cases may require a labral reconstruction, where Dr. Wichman will replace your labrum with other tissue to re-create the function of your labrum.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h4 id="osteoarthritis">OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE HIP</h4>
  Osteoarthritis of the hip is the loss of articular cartilage in the hip joint.<br>
  <br>

  Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip typically complain of pain in the groin, buttock, and thigh, described as a dull ache and throbbing pain that is worse when standing, sitting, and walking. Patients report noticing a decrease in the range of motion, and sometimes difficulty putting on socks and shoes. People also complain of pain at night and pain that causes them to limp when walking.<br>
  <br>

  Osteoarthritis can be diagnosed by plain X-rays. Treatment for osteoarthritis of the hip varies. The initial treatment consists of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, etc.) and application of ice to relieve the pain and inflammation in the hip joint. If loss of motion has occurred, stretching exercises or physical therapy is recommended to maintain range of motion. Steroid injections are often provided for symptomatic relief; Dr. Wichman is often able to perform these injections in the office under ultrasound guidance.<br>
  <br>

  If the osteoarthritis is advanced and conservative treatment has failed, often a total hip replacement is necessary for pain relief and return to function.<br>
  <br>

  In a total hip replacement (also called total hip arthroplasty), the damaged bone and cartilage is removed and replaced with prosthetic components.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>The damaged femoral head is removed and replaced with a metal stem that is placed into the hollow center of the femur. The femoral stem may be either cemented or "press fit" into the bone.</li>
    <li>A metal or ceramic ball is placed on the upper part of the stem. This ball replaces the damaged femoral head that was removed.</li>
    <li>The damaged cartilage surface of the socket (acetabulum) is removed and replaced with a metal socket. Screws or cement are sometimes used to hold the socket in place.</li>
    <li>A plastic, ceramic, or metal spacer is inserted between the new ball and the socket to allow for a smooth gliding surface.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <br>

  <h5>Is Hip Replacement Surgery for You?</h5>
  The decision to have hip replacement surgery should be a cooperative one made by you, your family, your primary care doctor, and your orthopaedic surgeon.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Candidates for Surgery</h5>
  There are no absolute age or weight restrictions for total hip replacements.<br>
  <br>

  Recommendations for surgery are based on a patient's pain and disability, not age. Most patients who undergo total hip replacement are age 50 to 80, but orthopaedic surgeons evaluate patients individually. Total hip replacements have been performed successfully at all ages, from the young teenager with juvenile arthritis to the elderly patient with degenerative arthritis.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>When Surgery Is Recommended</h5>
  There are several reasons why your doctor may recommend hip replacement surgery. People who benefit from hip replacement surgery often have:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Hip pain that limits everyday activities, such as walking or bending</li>
    <li>Hip pain that continues while resting, either day or night</li>
    <li>Stiffness in a hip that limits the ability to move or lift the leg</li>
    <li>Inadequate pain relief from anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, or walking supports</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h5>The Orthopaedic Evaluation</h5>
  An evaluation with an orthopaedic surgeon consists of several components.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Medical history:</strong> Your orthopaedic surgeon will gather information about your general health and ask questions about the extent of your hip pain and how it affects your ability to perform everyday activities.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Physical examination:</strong> This will assess hip mobility, strength, and alignment.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>X-rays:</strong> These images help to determine the extent of damage or deformity in your hip.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Other tests:</strong> Occasionally other tests, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, may be needed to determine the condition of the bone and soft tissues of your hip.<br>
  <br>

  <h4 id="fractures">HIP FRACTURES</h4>
  A hip fracture is a break in the upper quarter of the femur (thigh) bone. The extent of the break depends on the forces that are involved. The type of surgery used to treat a hip fracture is primarily based on the bones and soft tissues affected or on the level of the fracture.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h5>Normal Anatomy of the Hip</h5>
  The "hip" is a ball-and-socket joint. It allows the upper leg to bend and rotate at the pelvis. An injury to the socket, or acetabulum, itself is not considered a "hip fracture." Management of fractures to the socket is a completely different consideration.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Causes</h5>
  Hip fractures most commonly occur from a fall or from a direct blow to the side of the hip. Some medical conditions such as osteoporosis, cancer, or stress injuries can weaken the bone and make the hip more susceptible to breaking. In severe cases, it is possible for the hip to break with the patient merely standing on the leg and twisting.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Symptoms</h5>
  The patient with a hip fracture will have pain over the outer upper thigh or in the groin. There will be significant discomfort with any attempt to flex or rotate the hip. If the bone has been weakened by disease (such as a stress injury or cancer), the patient may notice aching in the groin or thigh area for a period of time before the break. If the bone is completely broken, the leg may appear to be shorter than the noninjured leg. The patient will often hold the injured leg in a still position with the foot and knee turned outward (external rotation).<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Doctor Examination</h5>
  The diagnosis of a hip fracture is generally made by an X-ray of the hip and femur.<br>
  <br>

  Hip fractures occur at the upper end of the thigh bone (femur). In some cases, if the patient falls and complains of hip pain, an incomplete fracture may not be seen on a regular X-ray. In that case, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be recommended. The MRI scan will usually show a hidden fracture.<br>
  <br>

  An MRI may identify a hip fracture otherwise missed on plain X-ray. If the patient is unable to have an MRI scan because of an associated medical condition, computed tomography (CT) may be obtained instead. Computed tomography, however, is not as sensitive as MRI for seeing hidden hip fractures.<br>
  <br>

  <br>

  <h4>TYPES OF FRACTURES</h4>
  In general, there are three different types of hip fractures. The type of fracture depends on what area of the upper femur is involved.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Intracapsular Fracture</h5>
  These fractures occur at the level of the neck and the head of the femur, and are generally within the capsule. The capsule is the soft-tissue envelope that contains the lubricating and nourishing fluid of the hip joint itself.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip3.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  <h5>Intertrochanteric Fracture</h5>
  This fracture occurs between the neck of the femur and a lower bony prominence called the lesser trochanter. The lesser trochanter is an attachment point for one of the major muscles of the hip. Intertrochanteric fractures generally cross in the area between the lesser trochanter and the greater trochanter. The greater trochanter is the bump you can feel under the skin on the outside of the hip. It acts as another muscle attachment point.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Subtrochanteric Fracture</h5>
  This fracture occurs below the lesser trochanter, in a region that is between the lesser trochanter and an area approximately 2 1/2 inches belowf. This occurs even further down the bone and may be broken into several pieces.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip4.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  <h5>Doctor Examination</h5>
  The diagnosis of a hip fracture is generally made by an X-ray of the hip and femur.<br>
  <br>

  Hip fractures occur at the upper end of the thigh bone (femur). In some cases, if the patient falls and complains of hip pain, an incomplete fracture may not be seen on a regular X-ray. In that case, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be recommended. The MRI scan will usually show a hidden fracture.<br>
  <br>

  An MRI may identify a hip fracture otherwise missed on plain X-ray. If the patient is unable to have an MRI scan because of an associated medical condition, computed tomography (CT) may be obtained instead. Computed tomography, however, is not as sensitive as MRI for seeing hidden hip fractures.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <hr>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h4>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h4>
  In more complicated cases, the amount of breakage of the bone can involve more than one of these zones. This is taken into consideration when surgical repair is considered.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Considerations</h5>
  Once the diagnosis of the hip fracture has been made, the patient's overall health and medical condition will be evaluated. In very rare cases, the patient may be so ill that surgery would not be recommended. In these cases, the patient's overall comfort and level of pain must be weighed against the risks of anesthesia and surgery. Most surgeons agree that patients do better if they are operated on fairly quickly. It is, however, important to insure patients' safety and maximize their overall medical health before surgery. This may mean taking time to do cardiac and other diagnostic studies.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Nonsurgical Treatment</h5>
  Stable Impacted Fracture. Certain fractures that have not moved ("displaced") may not require surgery. Because there is a risk that they may move later on, they are often fixed.<br>
  <br>

  Patients who might be considered for nonsurgical treatment include those who are too ill to undergo any form of anesthesia and people who were unable to walk before their injury and may have been confined to a bed or a wheelchair.<br>
  <br>

  Certain types of fractures may be considered stable enough to be managed with nonsurgical treatment. Because there is some risk that these "stable" fractures may instead prove unstable and displace (change position), the doctor will need to follow with periodic X-rays of the area. If patients are confined to bed rest as part of the management for these fractures, they will need to be closely monitored for complications that can occur from prolonged immobilization. These include infections, bed sores, pneumonia, the formation of blood clots, and nutritional wasting.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip5.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  <h5>Surgical Treatment</h5>
  <strong>Before Surgery:</strong> Anesthesia for surgery could be either general anesthesia with a breathing tube or spinal anesthesia. In very rare circumstances, where only a few screws are planned for fixation, local anesthesia with heavy sedation can be considered. All patients will receive antibiotics during surgery and for the 24-hours afterward.<br>
  <br>

  Appropriate blood tests, chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, and urine samples will be obtained before surgery. Many elderly patients may have undiagnosed urinary tract infections that could lead to an infection of the hip after surgery. The surgeon's decision as to how to best fix a fracture will be based on the area of the hip that is broken and the surgeon's familiarity with the different systems that are available to manage these injuries.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Intracapsular Fracture:</strong> If the head of the femur ("ball") alone is broken, management will be aimed at fixing the cartilage on the ball that has been injured or displaced. Frequently with these injuries, the socket, or acetabulum, may also be broken. The surgeon will need to take this into consideration as well.<br>
  <br>

  These injuries may be approached either from either the front or back of the hip. In some cases, both approaches are required in order to clearly see and fix the injured bone.<br>
  <br>

  For true intracapsular hip fractures, the surgeon may decide either to fix the fracture with individual screws (percutaneous pinning) or a single larger screw that slides within the barrel of a plate. This compression hip screw will allow the fracture to become more stable by having the broken area impact on itself. Occasionally, a secondary screw may be added for stability.<br>
  <br>

  Repair of an intracapsular fracture with individual screws (<strong>left</strong>) and of an intracapsular fracture with a single compression hip screw (<strong>right</strong>).<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip6.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  If the intracapsular hip fracture is displaced in a younger patient, a surgical attempt will be made to reduce, or realign, the fracture through a larger incision. The fracture will be held together with either individual screws or with the larger compression hip screw. In these cases, the blood supply to the ball, or head of the femur, may have been damaged at the time of injury (avascular necrosis). Even though the fracture is realigned and fixed into place, the cartilage and underlying supporting bone may not receive adequate blood. Over a period of time, this may cause the femoral head to flatten out. When this occurs, the joint surface becomes irregular. Ultimately, the hip joint may develop a painful arthritis, despite the surgical repair.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip7.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  Although the fracture is repaired, the blood supply to the "ball" of the femur is damaged. In the older patient, the chance that the head of the femur is damaged in this way is higher. It is generally felt that for these displaced fractures, patients will do better if some of the components of the hip are replaced. In some cases, this can mean a replacement of the ball, or head of the femur (hemiarthroplasty). In other cases, this can mean the replacement of both the ball and socket, or head of the femur and acetabulum (total hip replacement).<br>

  <div style="clear: both;"></div>
  <br>

  <strong>Intertrochanteric Fracture:</strong> Repair of an intertrochanteric fracture with an intramedullary nail. The nail is in the hollow cavity of the femur (thighbone) rather than on the side of it (as with a plate).<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip10.jpg" alt=""><br>
  <br>

  Most intertrochanteric fractures are managed with either a compression hip screw or an intramedullary nail, which also allows for impaction at the fracture site.<br>
  <br>

  The compression hip screw is fixed to the outer side of the bone with bone screws and has a large secondary screw (lag screw) that is placed through the plate into the neck and head of the hip (see compression hip screw figure above). The design of the device allows for impaction and compression at the fracture site. This may increase the stability of the area and promote healing.<br>
  <br>

  The intramedullary nail is placed directly into the marrow canal of the bone through an opening made at the top of the greater trochanter. A lag screw is then placed through the nail and up into the neck and head of the hip. As with the compression hip screw, sliding of the lag screw and impaction of the fracture take place.<br>
  <br>

  There are no definitive studies to show that one device is superior to another. The decision as to which to use is based on the surgeon's preference and experience.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Subtrochanteric Fracture:</strong> At the subtrochanteric level, most fractures are managed with a long intramedullary nail together with a large lag screw or they are managed with screws that capture the neck and head of the femur or the area immediately underneath it, if it has remained intact.<br>
  <br>

  <img src="images/hip11.jpg" alt="Repair of subtrochanteric fracture with a long intramedullary nail."><br>
  <span style="font-size: 87.5%; line-height: 1.5em;">Repair of subtrochanteric fracture with a long intramedullary nail.</span><br>
  <br>

  Interlocking screws at the end of the nail make the fixation more secure. In order to keep the bones from rotating around the nail or from shortening ("telescoping") on the nail, additional screws may be placed at the lower end of the nail in the area of the knee. These are called interlocking screws.<br>
  <br>

  In certain cases, the surgeon may choose to use a plate rather than a nail. The plate will have screws that go into the bone from the lateral, or outer, side of the femur. A single large screw goes into the neck and the head of the femur and appears similar to the compression hip screw, but at a different angle. Secondary screws are then placed through the plate into the bone to hold the fracture in place.<br>
  <br>

  <span style="font-size: 87.5%; line-height: 1.5em;">A locking plate may be used for more difficult to treat fractures.</span><br>
  <br>

  <h5>After Surgery</h5>
  Patients may be discharged from the hospital to their home or find that a stay in a rehabilitation facility is necessary to assist them in regaining their ability to walk.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Rehabilitation</h5>
  Patients may be encouraged to get out of bed on the day following surgery with the assistance of a physical therapist. The amount of weight that is allowed to be placed on the injured leg will be determined by the surgeon and is generally a function of the type of fracture and repair (fixation).<br>
  <br>

  The physical therapist will work with the patient to help regain strength and the ability to walk. This process may take up to three months.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Medical Care:</strong> Occasionally, a blood transfusion may be required after surgery, but longer term antibiotics are generally not necessary. Most patients will be placed on medicine to thin their blood to reduce the chances of developing blood clots for up to 6 weeks. These medicines may be in the form of pills or injections. Elastic compression stockings or inflatable compression boots may also be used.<br>
  <br>

  <h5>Follow Up Care</h5>
  During the appointments that take place after surgery, the surgeon will want to check the wound, remove sutures, follow the healing process using X-rays, and prescribe additional physical therapy, if necessary. Following hip fracture surgery, most patients will regain much, if not all, of the mobility and independence they had before the injury.
